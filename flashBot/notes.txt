#The pool set up in testing is where the arbitrage oppurtinities arbitrage
#Arbitraging same token across different fee pools
- best to do with trade that going to profit too (eg amount out higher than amount in)

1. In the test swap ratio is built however this can be determined from amount in and out.
500     = 1:1 1,1 10,10
3000    = 1:2 1,2 10,20
10000   = 2:1 1,0.5 10,5

#borrow from the first pool (1:1)
#input token1 into second pool (1:2) this gets us the first token at a positive trade
#input token0 into third pool this gets us the second token at a positive trade
##where ever the fee is higher trade back in.
##this only works if 1 pool is close to average, 1 pool is close to one direction and one pool is close to the other?

#once the trade are complete we pay back the tokens left over and this gives us the tokens from the first pool
