SCALP TRADER
- Leave inverse bot till later
- Run the geckbot if the potential new price is above 50% run the TRADER
- Close it after 1 hr and compare
- If all gecko tests pass this should profit



ARBITRAGE TRADER

- Needs  Â£200

Next steps
- Filter only the most recent pools from the pool finder
- but only ones with [USDC,USDT,DAI, MIM?, BOB?]
- - find a cleaner way to get only these tokens.
- - tbh it could work with other pairs but confusing to work with
- Check the direction that will lead to profit
- probably best to work in the lower fee pools?

- combine the algorithm from the first video and liquidity pools to determine true opportunituy
- Don't rewrite function 
- Just check if the 

you've already done uni vs sushi price
now just get the spread
check  it above the fee amount and less than a few seconds ago.

-if yes then you can run a swap
-for now run the regular swap
-if it works run a flash swap
